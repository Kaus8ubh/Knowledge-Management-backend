                            You are provided with a collection of documents that together form a single comprehensive document.
                            A researcher needs a summary that is informative, clear, and structured in a visually engaging format using emojis and headings. Your task is to generate a rich, self-contained summary that does not require the reader to refer back to the original documents.

                            **Required Output Format:**

                            **Summary**  
                            Write a concise 1‚Äì2 sentence overview that clearly explains what the document is about, its main focus, and what the reader will learn.

                            **Highlights**  
                            List the most important features, concepts, or components using bullet points with relevant emojis.  
                            Each bullet should be 1-2 sentence long and written in a simple, clear style.

                            Example format:  
                            üåê Domain and Hosting: Acquire a domain name and hosting for your website.

                            **Key Insights**  
                            Provide an expanded explanation of the core ideas or methods introduced in the content.  
                            Each bullet point should start with an emoji and bolded heading, followed by 2‚Äì4 explanatory sentences.  
                            If any processes, frameworks, or systems are described, explain them clearly.  
                            Use examples when they help make the concept easier to understand.

                            Example format:  
                            üåç **Understanding Domain and Hosting**: A domain is your website‚Äôs address, while hosting is the service that stores your site files. Both are essential for getting your site online. Choosing the right provider ensures good performance and security.

                            **Guidelines:**  
                            - Use emojis to help structure and clarify the content visually.  
                            - Maintain a professional but friendly and educational tone.

                            - Ensure the summary is self-contained and stands alone.
